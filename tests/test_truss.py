"""
Tests for the Truss class.

A Truss is a linear element that transmits axial force only (hinged connections at both ends).
It has 3 degrees of freedom per joint in 3D: ux, uy, uz.

Key methods:
    - length(): Element length between joints
    - direction_cosines_vector(): Unit vector along truss axis
    - rotation_matrix(): 3x3 rotation from local to global
    - rotation_transformation_matrix(): 12x12 transformation matrix
    - local_stiffness_matrix(): 12x12 stiffness in local coords
    - global_stiffness_matrix(): Stiffness in global coords

Typical usage:
    structure = Structure()
    structure.add_material('steel', modulus_elasticity=200e9)
    structure.add_section('circle', area=0.01)
    structure.add_joint('N1', x=0)
    structure.add_joint('N2', x=5)
    structure.add_truss('T1', 'N1', 'N2', 'steel', 'circle')
    truss = structure.elements['T1']
    length = truss.length()
