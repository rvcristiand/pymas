"""
Tests for the Support class.

A Support defines boundary conditions at a joint, specifying which degrees of freedom
are restrained. Supports prevent translation and/or rotation at a joint.

Degrees of freedom in 3D:
    - Translational: ux, uy, uz (translation along x, y, z axes)
    - Rotational: rx, ry, rz (rotation about x, y, z axes)

Methods:
    - restrains(): Returns boolean array of restrained DOFs (filtered by structure type)

Typical usage:
    structure = Structure('space_frame')
    structure.add_joint('N1', x=0, y=0, z=0)
    structure.add_support('N1', r_ux=True, r_uy=True, r_uz=True)
    support = structure.supports['N1']
    restrains = support.restrains()  # array([True, True, True, False, False, False])
