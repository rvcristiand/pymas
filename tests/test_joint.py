Tests for the Joint class.

A Joint represents a node in the structural model with spatial coordinates (x, y, z).
Joints define the endpoints of structural elements (trusses, frames) and can have
supports and loads applied to them.

Typical usage:
    structure = Structure('space_frame')
    joint = structure.add_joint('N1', x=0, y=0, z=0)
    coordinates = joint.position()  # array([0, 0, 0])
