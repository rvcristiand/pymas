Tests for the Material class.

The Material class represents a linear elastic material with elastic modulus (E)
and shear modulus (G) properties. It is used to define the material properties
of structural elements like trusses and frames.

Typical usage:
    structure = Structure('space_frame')
    material = structure.add_material('steel', E=200e9)
    print(material.E)  # 200000000000.0
